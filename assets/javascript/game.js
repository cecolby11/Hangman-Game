// computer picks word randomly
  // pick a theme
  // make an array of words that fit the theme
  // computer randomly selects a word from the array

// user guesses a letter
  // array of possible letter guesses, make sure they picked an acceptable key or else tell them to guess a-z
   // tell game to pay attention to the keyup
  // save the key pressed as a variable

// check if letter in word. yay! or boo.
   // if then logic to see if it's in the word... 
      // look for methods to do this. can we check if a char is in a string? or break the string into an array and check if it's matching element in array?

// display letters guessed, update after each guess
  // if they got it wrong, add their letter to this array 
  // update what's displayed on the screen

// display progress on the word, update after each guess
  // if they got it right, add their letter to this array 
  // update what's displayed on the screen

// display number of guesses remaining, update after each guess
  // counter starts at 12? 
  // decrease by 1 after each guess
  // update what's displayed on the screen

// display # wins! if word is guessed in time, this goes up
